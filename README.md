**Recently Added**

* Initial version just created.
* New scenarios can be created.
* Player dialog shows X, Y, Z, and facing start values as well as starting inventory items.
* Editing player dialog values persists (the scenario objects are updated).
* Inactive Props can be added (when creating new scenario).
* Inactive features of application are now indicative of this nature via warning messages (and timers work).

**To do**

* Items in Floors box need to open Floor Dialog, and so on.
* Items in Conversations box need to open Conversation Dialog.
* Items in Triggers box need to open Trigger Dialog.
* Add buttons for Edit and Remove under Floors, Conversations, Triggers.
* Open Scenario - Parsing JSON: http://qtwiki.remdex.info/Parsing_JSON_with_QT_using_standard_QT_library
* Save Scenario to JSON

**To do later**

* Trigger Tracker - more details on triggers (how they are started, how many entry points they have, etc)
* Objective Tracker - same as trigger tracker, for objectives
* Prop Manager - e.g. When adding inactive props, be able to search the prop collection
